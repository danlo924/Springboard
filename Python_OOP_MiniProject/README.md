# Banking System Case Study
Users should be able to execute the console.py file and simulate a customer session at a bank from begining to end.

The customer session should be able to handle new and existing customers, and perform 0 to ∞ transactions until the customer is done.

Various transactions that the Customer can initiate include the following:
    deposits
    withdrawals
    loan payments
    opening a new account
    closing an account
    opening a new loan for a specific amount and length of time

Account balances should be handled and saved after each transaction.

If the customer is done with their transaction(s) during the session, they may enter 'done' to exit the program.
